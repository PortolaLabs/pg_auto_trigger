TableFlow is an open source data import platform for businesses to onboard their customers. Instead of building CSV and Excel import support from scratch, you can embed or link to the TableFlow importer and begin collecting data from customers immediately.

You can get started with [TableFlow Cloud](https://app.tableflow.com) or [self host](https://github.com/tableflowhq/tableflow) in your own infrastructure.
